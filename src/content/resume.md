- **Platform Engineering Manager** - April 2025 - Present
- **Principal Platform Engineer** - October 2024 - April 2025
- **Tech Lead** - December 2022 - April 2025

- **DevOps Engineer** - March 2021 - March 2022

*I first joined the team building our client-facing API, as the DevOps Engineer in a team otherwise composed by developers and testers. During my first months, I had 2 main responsibilities and in both cases, I took a modular approach, creating re-usable building blocks.*

- *Coding a declarative definition (Infrastructure as Code - Terraform) of all the resources the team was using in Azure.*
- *Taking care of standardazing the App Delivery process (or SDLC) for all our microservices, through pipeline templates (Azure DevOps).*

*Once my building block (Terraform Modules, pipeline templates) approach was in place, I was able to easily extend it to other teams. Some teams that already had some familiarity with pipeline definition or with Terraform were able to consume the "blocks" in a self-service way, but I was also involved in helping other teams adopt these solutions.*

*After having built all of these blocks to help people use an external platform (Azure), we built a new team and started building a Platform on top of Kubernetes. There, my responsibilites range from designing the architechture and functionality of the platform, to implementing it, to getting developers in Banking Circle to use it; while ensuring everyone in the team is feeling well, learning and able to deliver on our Vision.*

*This Kubernetes platform includes a series of CNCF-hosted, other open-source and also propietary software. Among others, we use ArgoCD, Cilium, Grafana, Kyverno or Trivy. We not only put pieces together, but build a cohesive, intuitive interface on top, to ensure people can use it efficiently and in a self-service fashion, without having to understand the underlying complexity; as well as to ensure everything we do on it is secure and compliant*

*Additionally, in my team we maintain two other Platforms: One for inter-application communication (i.e. a messaging bus) and one for infrasturecture provisioning*

## Saxo Bank - 2018-2021

- **DevOps Engineer** - December 2019 - February 2021
- **IT Graduate** - September 2018 - December 2019

*I first joined Saxo's Graduate program, where I spent some months working in each of these teams: Data Science, Data Engineering and finally the Data in Motion team (Kafka), in which I worked as a DevOps Engineer.*

*After the Graduate program ended, I stayed in that last team (Data in Motion) as a DevOps Engineer, working with Kafka, Azure, Azure DevOps, Ansible, git or Grafana; making our developments faster and our infrastructure more reliable*
